# Designed-and-Verified-a-16-1-MUX-using-2-1-MUX-and-4-1-MUX-using-Verilog-HDL
– Designed a structural model of 2:1 MUX which is initialised 3 times to design 4:1 MUX. – 4:1 MUX is initialised 5 times to design 16:1 MUX in structural model. 2:1 MUX is used 15 times to design a 16:1 MUX. – Developed and implemented a testbench to verify the functionality of a 16:1 MUX, ensuring accurate performance across all input combi.
